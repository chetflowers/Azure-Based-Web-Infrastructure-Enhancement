# Azure-Based-Web-Infrastructure-Enhancement

Overview
This project focuses on developing and securing a cloud-based web application designed to host a cybersecurity blog. Built on Azure, the platform prioritizes high availability, scalability, and robust security, serving as a resilient environment for sharing cybersecurity insights and updates.

Key Components
- Cloud Infrastructure: Deployed using Azure App Service for web hosting and Azure SQL Database for data storage, ensuring seamless scalability and reliability.
- Backend: Implemented with Flask for backend logic and Bootstrap for frontend design, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Authentication & Authorization: Integrated with Azure Active Directory (AAD) to enhance access control and secure the application against unauthorized access.

Traffic & Security Measures
- Azure Front Door: Configured to enforce HTTPS traffic, ensuring secure communication and optimized content delivery.
- Web Application Firewall (WAF): Custom rules applied to mitigate threats such as SQL injection, PHP injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implemented for managing user permissions and controlling access to sensitive resources.
- Security Best Practices: Regular audits, updates, and SSL/TLS certificates applied to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.

Vulnerability Mitigation
- WAF Custom Rules: Example rules include blocking traffic from specific regions and filtering malicious patterns in requests.
- Input Validation & Sanitization: Applied to prevent injection attacks and ensure robust backend security.

Summary
This project successfully establishes a secure, scalable platform for disseminating cybersecurity knowledge. By leveraging Azureâ€™s cloud services and adhering to industry best practices, the application ensures high performance while remaining resilient to potential threats.
